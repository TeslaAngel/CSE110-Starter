## Brief Introduction
Hello, I'm Mohan, I'm a freelance **3D designer**, **musician** (kind of) and is currently pursuing a CS degree in UCSD.
In general, I like creating funny or cool things out of my computer, which is why I'm now doing CS here.
You can check some of my works [Here](https://www.artstation.com/teslaangel7).

And here's my current work-in-progress:

## About Programming
In general, I don't like math, and I'm terrible in stuffs like leetcode. However, I still love to create entertaining things like minigames on my computer, which is why I haven't yet switched my major. And, programming is useful in almost any field of work today, just as what *Ram Ray* said:
> No matter which field of work you want to go in, it is of great importance to learn at least one programming language.

I also like the vision and opportunities that computer science can bring me, just like how everyone write their first line of code:
```
cout << "Hello, World!";
```
Career wise though, I'm struggling to find internship right now since my code doesn't look good; I never pass any online assessment and I spend a lot of time just to make PAs work. Hopefully I can learn the way to improve in this class.

## About myself
I'm a gamer and tech people, I used to have a 3D printer (which I couldn't carry to SD) and I invented some pretty cool small items with it for sale. It was a fun time adjusting the machine and produce things I designed in real life.
For games, I play the Legend of Zelda series and WARNO. I like fun games that are intellectually challenging and with intuitive designs. These work also deeply influenced my art style, which you can find Here: [Brief Introduction](#brief-introduction).
